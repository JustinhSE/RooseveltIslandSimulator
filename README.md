- **Camera Scene:** ðŸ“· This scene features different camera angles such as frontal, overhead right/left, mirror right/left, and the back. It was tested using various cubes with C# movement scripts.

- **Island Scene:** ðŸŒ´ This scene features views from different camera angles of the bus to test on the main driving simulator. The cameras include frontal, overhead right/left, mirror right/left, and the back. It was tested by adding rigidbodies to the bus to allow for movement around the digital Roosevelt Island.

- **Whole Car Scene:** ðŸš— This scene incorporates the Car Prefab extracted from the Island Scene with the Camera Scene. It features the same camera angles as the Camera Scene. 

The project is built using C# for movement scripts and tested using Unity.
